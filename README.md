# ðŸš™  Car Dealership Database: MySQL
## Interesting Piece of the Code 
An interesting discovery I made while completeing this project was learning the difference between PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY. 

PRIMARY KEY is a column / set of columns in a table that are unique identifiers for each row in a table, it also must not contain NULL values. 

FOREIGN KEY is used along with the REFERENCES keyword. This is a column / set of columns in a table that establishes a relationship between two tables. 

Together these key words create a parent - child relationship (similar to Inheritance in Java). 

## Why do we use PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY?
We use them to maintain data integrity, represent relationships between entities, optimize query performance, and improve database maintainability.
